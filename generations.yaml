    description: "The BMW iX is the brand's flagship electric SUV, built on a dedicated electric vehicle platform featuring an aluminum spaceframe and carbon cage construction with extensive use of carbon fiber reinforced plastic (CFRP). Its controversial exterior design incorporates a large, blanked-off kidney grille (housing cameras and sensors), slim LED headlights, flush door handles, and aerodynamically optimized styling elements. The iX is available in multiple variants, including the xDrive40 with 322 HP, xDrive50 with 516 HP, and high-performance M60 with 610 HP. All versions feature dual-motor all-wheel drive. Battery capacity ranges from 71 kWh (net) in the xDrive40 to 105.2 kWh in the xDrive50 and M60, providing EPA-rated ranges of up to 324 miles. The interior represents a significant departure from traditional BMW design, featuring a minimalist approach with a hexagonal steering wheel, floating curved display combining digital instruments and infotainment, and sustainable materials. Advanced technology includes BMW's iDrive 8 system, augmented reality navigation, and Level 2+ driver assistance capabilities. The iX supports DC fast charging at up to 195 kW, allowing a 10-80% charge in as little as 35 minutes. As BMW's technology flagship, the iX showcases the brand's fifth-generation eDrive technology and sets the direction for future electric BMW models with its combination of performance, range, and innovation."
